## Running the application locally

To run food-ordering-system locally, complete the following steps:

### Prerequisites

You have to install the following software components to set up project environment locally:

* JDK 11
* Apache Maven

#### Start

Check the current java version:

```
java -version
```

If the current version is different from 11, set up the `JAVA_HOME` variable to java 11, because
maven uses the `JAVA_HOME` variable for build and execute.

food-ordering-system directory:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
